#️# Airbnb Market Intelligence (New York City)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listings data for New York City to uncover how pricing and ratings vary across neighborhoods and room types.  
The goal is to identify patterns that influence nightly rates and host performance.  
All analysis, cleaning, and visualization were performed in **R using tidyverse**, and the final report was rendered with **R Markdown**.

## Key Insights
- **Manhattan** has the highest average nightly prices, followed by **Brooklyn** — reflecting tourism density.  
- **Entire homes/apartments** command 2-3× higher prices than private or shared rooms.  
- **Higher-rated listings** correlate with slightly higher nightly rates, showing that host quality drives price.  
- Typical market prices fall between **\$80–\$250** per night after removing outliers.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling and cleaning (`dplyr`, `readr`)  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization (`ggplot2`)  
- R Markdown report automation  
- Git/GitHub version control  
- Project organization and reproducible workflow
